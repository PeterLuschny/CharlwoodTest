The Charlwood Integration Test Suite
====================================

A Sage worksheet for testing Charlwood's fifty integration problems.
(Also as in .py and .ipynb format.)  

These are the problems given by Kevin Charlwood in his article 
"Integration on Computer Algebra Systems". 

    In this article Charlwood considers indefinite integrals and the 
    ability of computer algebra systems to evaluate them in closed-form,
    appealing only to the class of real, elementary functions.
